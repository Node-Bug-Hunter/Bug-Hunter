# Bug-Hunter: NodeJS error reporting service

[![Version npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bug-hunter.svg?logo=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bug-hunter)

> **:fire:Attention!**
> -----------------------------------------------
> Working on some critical features, need to iteratively test and monitor application health, performance, and network. Introducing breaking changes with a custom dashboard and a magic login feature. During this time, the Bug-Hunter server may not respond as expected. Kindly cooperate while I'm implementing these features.

> New documentation coming soon...
